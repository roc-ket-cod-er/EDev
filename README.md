# EDev

EDev is a small form-factor ESP32-S3 based devboard, featuring 18 GPIO, 26 Ground Pins, and a built-in battery holder.

I made EDev because I was sort of tired of seeing devboards with all the great features, except prototypability. When I say this, I mean how easy is it to use? Most of the stuff I saw had everything right ... except they lacked in ground pins. When you want to test an led, switch, button, buzzer, or any other 2-pin device, it is super conveninent to have a ground pin next to every GPIO pin. The PCB is you breadboard in 80% of cases! In addition, each pin is labeled, and it can accept upto 20V of power!
