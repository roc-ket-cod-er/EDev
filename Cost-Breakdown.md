$2 for the PCB, and $34.52 for the PCBA, out of which $8 is the setup, $12 is for the extended components setup (SMD headers, USB-C, ESP32 module, LDO) and ~$12 is for components.

Naturally, the total of $36.52 gets $7.54 of shipping added, and is taxed at 13% and charged some minor duties ($6.58), totaling $50.64. However, I happen to have a coupon of $9, so it comes to a final total of $41.64
